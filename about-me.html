            My name is Juul Vrasdonk. I am a 19-year-old student at CMD living in Amsterdam. 
            I started at CMD in 2019. Digital Design became my passion from that moment on. 
            Throughout my study I developed a big interest for both Web Development and UX/UI design. 
            Besides my study, I’m also working as a student-assistent at CMD. 
            This means that I’m helping teachers by giving students feedback on their projects.

            If I’m not designing, I’m probably playing football, Guitar or Piano. 
            Or I’m doing typical student stuff🍺.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right now I’m looking for an internship at a Digital Design agency. 
            The internship is starting <strong>September 2022</strong> and ends <strong>Januari 2023</strong>.
